# 1) We’ve opened up a communications link to The Fender‘s secret computer. We need you to write a program that will read in the compromised usernames and passwords that are stored in a file called "passwords.csv". First import the CSV module, since we’ll be needing it to parse the data:

import csv

# 2) We need to create a list of users whose passwords have been compromised, create a new list and save it to the variable compromised_users:

compromised_users = []

# 3.1) Pass the password_file object holder to our CSV reader for parsing. Save the parsed csv. DictReader object as password_csv:

# 3.2) Now we’ll want to iterate through each of the lines in the CSV. Create a for loop and save each row of the CSV into the temporary variable password_row:

# 3.3) Inside your for loop, print out password_row['Username']. This is the username of the person whose password was compromised. Run your code, do you see a list of usernames?:

with open('passwords.csv') as password_file:
  password_csv = csv.DictReader(password_file)
  for password_row in password_csv:
    print(password_row['Username'])
