# Codecademy-Projects
A Portfolio of the coding projects I have completed, as part of the Learn Python Codecademy course.


Block Letters:

-'ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters'. 
I have Written a Python program that displays the initials of my name in block letters and have now "dipped my toes" into ASCII art.

Receipts for Lovely Loveseats:

- I have written a Python program designed for a small-business that sells furniture. This program builds a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for customers, storing the names and prices for the furniture items in variables. It will then process the total price and item list for the customers, printing them to the output terminal.
