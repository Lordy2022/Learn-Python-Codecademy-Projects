# Learn Python 3 - Codecademy Projects

Block Letters:

- 'ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters'. 
I have Written a Python program that displays the initials of my name in block letters and have now "dipped my toes" into ASCII art.

Receipts for Lovely Loveseats:

- I have written a Python program designed for a small-business that sells furniture 'Lovely Loveseats'. This program builds a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for customers, storing the names and prices for the furniture items in variables. It will then process the total price and item list for the customers, printing them to the output terminal.

Magic 8-Ball:

- The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking. I have created a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

Gradebook:

- I have written a Python program to organize a students subjects and grades for half of an academic year - creating a mid-term gradebook.

Len's Slice:

- Len’s Slice is a new pizza joint in the neighbourhood. I have used my knowledge of Python lists to organize some of the restaurants sales data.     

Carly's Clippers:

- I am now doing some Data Analyst work for the small business Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. My job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. I then calculated some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.  

Getting Ready for Physics Class:

- I am helping a physics teacher who is preparing for the upcoming semester. His aims are to provide his students with some functions, that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

Thread Shed:

- I have been brought in to modernize the operations of Thread Shed, a local sewing hobby shop. Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales. All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased and the date of sale are all recorded in this same string. I will employ my Python programming skills, to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier to access lists.

Scrabble:

- In this project, I have processed some data from a group of friends playing scrabble, using dictionaries to organize players, words and points.

Abruptly Goblins Planner Project:

- Opening your comic book store, the Sorcery Society, has been a lifelong dream come true. You quickly diversified your shop offerings to include miniatures, plush toys, collectible card games, and board games. Eventually, the store became more a games store with a selection of this week's newest comic books and a small offering of graphic novel paperbacks. Completing your transformation means offering space for local tabletop gamers. They love to play their favorite RPG, "Abruptly Goblins!" and will happily pay you per chair to secure the space to do it. Unfortunately, planning the game night has fallen to you. You decide it's best that you automate the game night selector to get the most people through the door. You have enlisted my help and have asked me to use my knowledge of Python, to help make the night a success.

Hacking The Fender:

- The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access to The Fender‘s systems, you must update his "passwords.txt" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat. Use your knowledge of working with Python files to retrieve, manipulate, obscure, and create data in your quest for justice. Work with CSV files and other text files in this exploration of the strength of Python file programming.

Basta Fazoolin':

- You’ve started a position as the lead programmer for the family-style Italian restaurant Basta Fazoolin’ with My Heart. The restaurant has been doing fantastically and has seen a lot of growth lately. You’ve been hired to keep things organized.
