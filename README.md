# Learn Python 3 - Codecademy Projects

Block Letters:

- 'ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters'. 
I have Written a Python program that displays the initials of my name in block letters and have now "dipped my toes" into ASCII art.

Receipts for Lovely Loveseats:

- I have written a Python program designed for a small-business that sells furniture 'Lovely Loveseats'. This program builds a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for customers, storing the names and prices for the furniture items in variables. It will then process the total price and item list for the customers, printing them to the output terminal.

Magic 8-Ball:

- The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking. I have created a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

Gradebook:

- I have written a Python program to organize a students subjects and grades for half of an academic year - creating a mid-term gradebook.

Len's Slice:

- Len’s Slice is a new pizza joint in the neighbourhood. I have used my knowledge of Python lists to organize some of the restaurants sales data.     

Carly's Clippers:

- I am now a Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. My job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. I will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.  

- I was provided with three lists: 

  Hairstyles: The names of the cuts offered at Carly’s Clippers.
  Prices: The price of each hairstyle in the hairstyles list.
  Last week: The number of purchases for each hairstyle type in the last week.

  Each index in hairstyles corresponds to an associated index in prices and last_week. For example, The hairstyle "bouffant" has an associated price of 30 from the       prices list, and was purchased 2 times in the last week as shown in the last_week list. Each of these elements are in the first index of their respective lists.
