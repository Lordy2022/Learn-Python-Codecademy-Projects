#To keep track of the kinds of pizzas you sell, create a list called that holds different types of pizza toppings:

toppings = ["pepperoni", "pineapple", "cheese", "sausage", "olives", "anchovies", "mushrooms"]

#To keep track of how much each kind of pizza slice costs, create a list that holds the following integer values:

prices = [2, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 2]

#Your boss wants you to do some research on $2 slices. Count the number of occurrences of 2 in the prices list:

num_two_dollar_slices = prices.count(2)

#Find the length of the toppings list:

num_pizzas = len(toppings)

#Print the string We sell [num_pizzas] different kinds of pizza!, where [num_pizzas] represents the value of our variable num_pizzas:

print("We sell", num_pizzas, "different kinds of pizza!")

#Use the existing data about the pizza toppings and prices to create a new two-dimensional list:

pizza_and_prices = [[ 2, "pepperoni"], [6, "pineapple"], [1, "cheese"], [3,	"sausage"], [2,	"olives"], [7, "anchovies"], [2, "mushrooms"]]

#Sort pizza_and_prices so that the pizzas are in the order of increasing price:

pizza_and_prices.sort()
print(pizza_and_prices)

#Store the first element of pizza_and_prices in a variable called cheapest_pizza:

cheapest_pizza = pizza_and_prices[0]

#A man walks into the pizza store and shouts “I will have your MOST EXPENSIVE pizza!”:

priciest_pizza = pizza_and_prices[6] 

#It looks like the most expensive pizza from the previous step was our very last "anchovies" slice. Remove it from our pizza_and_prices list since the man bought the last slice:

pizza_and_prices.pop()

#Since there is no longer an "anchovies" pizza, you want to add a new topping called "peppers" to keep your customers excited about new toppings:

pizza_and_prices.insert(4, [2.5, "peppers"])

#Three mice walk into the store. They don’t have much money (they’re mice, but they do each want different pizzas. What are our three cheapest pizzas?:

print("Our cheapests Pizza's are:")
three_cheapest = pizza_and_prices[:3]

print(three_cheapest)
