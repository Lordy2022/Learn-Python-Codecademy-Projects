# Last semesters gradebook.

last_semester_gradebook = [["politics", 80], ["latin", 96], ["dance", 97], ["architecture", 65]]

# Mid-Year Gradebook.

# 1) A list of this semesters subjects:

subjects = ["physics", "calculus", "poetry", "history"]

# 2) A list of this semesters grades:

grades = [98, 97, 85, 88]

# 3) A list combining subjects and grades = This semesters gradebook:

gradebook = [["physics", 98], ["calculus", 97], ["poetry", 85], ["history", 88]]

# 4) Your grade for your computer science class just came in! You got a perfect score, 100!:

gradebook.append(["computer science", 100])

# 5) Your grade for "visual arts" just came in! You got a 93!:

gradebook.append(["visual arts", 93])

# 6) Our instructor just told us they made a mistake grading and are rewarding an extra 5 points, for our visual arts class:

gradebook[-1][-1] += 5

# 7) You decided to switch from a numerical grade value to a Pass/Fail option for your poetry class:

gradebook[2].remove(85)

# 8) Use the .append() method, to then add a new "Pass" value to the sublist where your poetry class is located:

gradebook[2].append("Pass")

# 9) You also have your grades from last semester, stored in last_semester_gradebook. Combine the two gradebooks, to create a mid-year gradebook:

full_gradebook = last_semester_gradebook + gradebook 

print(full_gradebook)
