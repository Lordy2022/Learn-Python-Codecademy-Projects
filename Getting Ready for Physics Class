# Write a function called f_to_c that takes an input f_temp (a temperature in Fahrenheit) and converts it to c_temp (that temperature in Celsius). It should then return celsius temperature:

def f_to_c(f_temp):
  c_temp = (f_temp - 32) * 5/9
  return c_temp


#Letâ€™s test your function with a value of 100 Fahrenheit:

f100_in_celsius = f_to_c(100)
